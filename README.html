<h1 id="teammanager">Team Manager</h1>

<p>Project for Database class</p>

<h2 id="howtouse">How to use</h2>

<ul>
<li>Run <code>$ python team-manage.py</code>from command line</li>
<li>Go to 127.0.0.1:5000</li>
<li>All links are working</li>
</ul>

<p>Disclaimer:
We did not have time to implement a login (as this wasn&#8217;t a top priority for a database project)
So&#8230; On the events page if you want to see an individual&#8217;s events for his sport then
you must add his email to the end of the url. I give an example on the events page itself. </p>
