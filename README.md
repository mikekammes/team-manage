# Team Manager
Project for Database class

## How to use
* Run `$ python team-manage.py`from command line
* Go to 127.0.0.1:5000 
* All links are working 

Disclaimer:
We did not have time to implement a login (as this wasn't a top priority for a database project)
So... On the events page if you want to see an individual's events for his sport then 
you must add his email to the end of the url. I give an example on the events page itself.
